# ViGaTu - Virtual Gastro Tutor
The ViGaTu project aims to create a VR-based teaching-learning system that will allow medical professionals, including experts, to learn the knowledge and abilities required to perform screening colonoscopies that adhere to guidelines.
The project has a modular framework for the generation of VR simulations to accelerate learning in endoscopy.
We are working on the open source content right now to enable a broader development of the project and to allow contributions from all domains.
