## Project & Framework
The ViGaTu project aims to create a VR-based teaching-learning system that will enable medical professionals, to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to perform guideline-based screening colonoscopies. ViGaTu is based on a modular framework for the generation of VR simulations, which is published here.
